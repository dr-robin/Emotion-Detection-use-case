## Project Goal
We try to detect facial microexpressions.

## Approach

- 1) trying to detect emotions in faces

## Background information

A microexpression is a very brief, involuntary facial expression humans make when experiencing
an emotion. They usually last 0.5–4.0 seconds and cannot be faked.

Microexpressions were first discovered by researchers Haggard and Isaacs.
Dr. Paul Ekman popularized the term “microexpression” and greatly expanded the research.

## Microexpressions examples

Microexpressions you can try to detect:

Surprise
The eyebrows are raised and curved.
Skin below the brow is stretched.
Horizontal wrinkles show across the forehead.
Eyelids are opened, white of the eye showing above and below.
Jaw drops open and teeth are parted but there is no tension or stretching of the mouth.

Fear
Eyebrows are raised and drawn together, usually in a flat line.
Wrinkles in the forehead are in the center between the eyebrows, not across.
Upper eyelid is raised, but the lower lid is tense and drawn up.
Eyes have the upper white showing, but not the lower white.
Mouth is open and lips are slightly tensed or stretched and drawn back

Disgust
Eyes are narrowed.
Upper lip is raised.
Upper teeth may be exposed.
Nose is wrinkled.
Cheeks are raised.

Anger
The eyebrows are lowered and drawn together.
Vertical lines appear between the eyebrows.
Lower lip is tensed.
Eyes are in hard stare or bulging.
Lips can be pressed firmly together, with corners down, or in a square shape as if shouting.
Nostrils may be dilated.
The lower jaw juts out.

Happy
Corners of the lips are drawn back and up.
Mouth may or may not be parted, teeth exposed.
A wrinkle runs from outer nose to outer lip.
Cheeks are raised.
Lower eyelid may show wrinkles or be tense.
Crow’s feet near the outside of the eyes.

Sadness
(It’s also one of the hardest microexpressions to correctly identify)
(one of the longer-lasting microexpressions.)
Inner corners of the eyebrows are drawn in and then up.
Skin below the eyebrows is triangulated, with inner corner up.
Corner of the lips are drawn down.
Jaw comes up.
Lower lip pouts out.

#Contempt
